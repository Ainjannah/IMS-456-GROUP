                <p>To be more specific, 2Â years before Malaya's independence, in August 1957, the humble beginnings of
                    Aik Cheong Coffee Roaster Sdn. Bhd. took form. The coffee bean commerce was developed in the rustic
                    and charming settings of a little wooden store on Temple Street in ancient Melaka Town. The early
                    priority were to import coffee beans from Indonesia, the Philippines, and South America, followed by
                    hand grinding, roasting, and packing for local market use.</p>

                <p>10 years later, the company moved to a slightly different location in the same area. As a result, we
                    relocated twice to considerably larger plants. Our enterprise, which is still run as a family
                    business, is currently located on an 8-acre plot in the Cheng Industrial Estate, some 4 km northeast
                    of Melaka's Historic City.</p>

                <p>Aik Cheong is proudly making a space for itself in the prime brewing and coffee consumption sectors
                    both
                    nationally and worldwide, thanks to cutting-edge electrical and mechanical sorting, grading,
                    roasting, and packing technology, as well as a highly qualified workforce.</p>

                <p>After 50 years, we can confidently state that we are still devoted to regularly supplying
                    high-quality gourmet beans, powder, and associated mixes that provide the finest in scent, body, and
                    flavour. Overall, the firm strives for innovation and daring in its product research and
                    development, while looking forward to the new century and spreading revitalised coffee brewing
                    passion throughout the world.</p>
